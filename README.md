## HOW TO RUN THE CODE: 
I have upload the full folder of the Brighton dataset to my google drive. Then I have wrote the code to import all the data files present the folder at once. For this the path of the folder where the dataset is needs to be given properly.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Our organization is starting a pilot initiative to give free electricity to nearby renewable sources to local customers during times of excess production in response to the growing cost of energy. This cutting-edge service is planned to go into trial in May 2024 and is intended to take advantage of the excess energy produced by solar and wind power. Creating a dependable forecasting system that can identify energy surpluses at least 24 hours in advance is the main goal. The corporation will be able to notify consumers about possible free energy periods using this technology, giving them the opportunity to opt-in and take advantage of the excess. We have been given access to a wealth of historical data going back to the year 2010 in order to properly execute this system. This information, which includes a range of parameters from local renewable energy sources, is essential to our capacity to forecast excess instances with any degree of accuracy. Creating a prediction model with as few false positives as possible is the difficult part since inaccurate surplus forecasts can cause large financial losses by providing free energy when it isn't available. The two primary phases of the project are Data Exploration and Modeling/Testing. The primary focus will be on comprehending and organizing the data, as well as developing precise definitions for energy excess levels that are grounded in in-depth analysis and historical data patterns. By encouraging the effective use of renewable energy, this effort not only helps the company's strategic aims but also aligns with broader environmental objectives. Our organization is commencing a pilot project in May 2024 to supply free electricity to customers near renewable sources during periods of surplus. To provide prompt customer warnings for opt-in opportunities, the objective is to design a predictive system that estimates excess energy from solar and wind sources 24 hours in advance. This system's development will be aided by the availability of historical data going back to 2000. In order to avoid financial losses from unjustified free energy distributions, the project's success depends on limiting false positives. Along with increasing customer interaction and promoting the use of renewable energy, this project also seeks to optimize energy usage, which is in line with sustainability objectives.

## ASSUMPTIONS:
Data Reliability: The project makes the assumption that historical meteorological information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation truly depicts the environmental factors that are important for the production of renewable energy. It also makes the assumption that records of energy output under these meteorological conditions are accurate and comprehensive  (Rodr√≠guez,2020).
Renewable Energy Generation: It is thought that weather-related factors and the production of renewable energy are directly correlated. Clear skies and lots of sunlight are thought to increase the amount of electricity that solar panels can produce. In a similar vein, higher wind speeds are thought to result in more energy being produced by wind turbines  (Devisingh,,2018).
Threshold Determination: Based on the availability of surplus energy, the project seeks to establish thresholds for the provision of free energy. It is assumed that excess energy results from the generation of renewable energy exceeding local energy demand. In addition to taking grid capacity and storage capacity into account, this analysis may entail looking at historical data on energy output and consumption  (Kumar,2019).
Consumer Behavior: It is implied that consumers will use energy efficiently and will respond favorably to offers of free energy. On the basis of the company's alerts, it is assumed that consumers in the target area will choose to get free energy during surplus periods. It could be necessary to do pilot tests or market research to further validate this premise (White,2018).
External Factors: While natural disasters, legislative changes, and technology developments may have an impact on energy production and consumption, they are not specifically addressed in this study. It is anticipated that these variables will be indirectly taken into consideration by the forecasting model through the use of trend analysis and historical data (White,2018).

## NOTE:
# Separation of Data Preprocessing and Model Building
I have split the data preprocessing and model building tasks into separate Jupyter notebooks. The model building notebook includes both the data preprocessing and model building code for the Brighton dataset.
# Data Preprocessing Notebook:
Contains all data preprocessing steps for the Brighton dataset.
Model Building Notebook:Includes both data preprocessing and model building code for the Brighton dataset.
This separation ensures modularity and ease of use while maintaining the required data preprocessing for model building.
